"gram atomic mass":{
word:"gram atomic mass",
lexicalCategory:"mass in gram/number of gram atom",
defination:"the quantity of an element whose weight in grams is numerically equal to the atomic weight of the element.",    
},
"determination of solubility":{
word:"determination of solubility",
lexicalCategory:"weight of solute/weight of solvent",
defination:"the ability to be dissolved, especially in water.",    
},
"mass percent":{
word:"mass percent",
lexicalCategory:"mass of the element in 1 mole compund/mass of 1 mole compound*100",
defination:"the mass fraction of a substance within a mixture is the ratio of the mass of that substance to the total mass of the mixture.",    
},
"mass percentage":{
word:"mass percentage",
lexicalCategory:"gram of the solute/gram of the solute+solvent*100",
defination:"the mass fraction of a substance within a mixture is the ratio of the mass of that substance to the total mass of the mixture.",    
},
"molality":{
word:"molality",
lexicalCategory:"number of moles in solute/weight of solvent in Kg",
defination:"Molality, also called molal concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution in terms of amount of substance in a specified amount of mass of the solvent. This contrasts with the definition of molarity which is based on a specified volume of solution.",    
},
"molarity":{
word:"molarity",
lexicalCategory:"M=n/v",
defination:"Molar concentration is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species, in particular of a solute in a solution, in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution.",    
},
"normality":{
word:"normality",
lexicalCategory:"number of equvivalents/volumes in litres",
defination:"Normality is a measure of concentration equal to the gram equivalent weight per liter of solution. Gram equivalent weight is the measure of the reactive capacity of a molecule. The solute's role in the reaction determines the solution's normality. Normality is also known as the equivalent concentration of a solution.",

"number of moles":{
word:"number of moles",
lexicalCategory:"given mass/molar mass",
defination:"The mole s the unit of measurement for amount of substance in the International System of Units (SI). ",

"number of equvivalents":{
word:"number of equvivalents",
lexicalCategory:"given mass/equvivalent mass",
defination:"Equivalent means equal in value, function, or meaning",

"equvivalent weight":{
word:"equvivalent weight",
lexicalCategory:"molar mass/valency factor",
defination:"Equivalent weight is the mass of one equivalent, that is the mass of a given substance which will combine with or displace a fixed quantity of another substance. The equivalent weight of an element is the mass which combines with or displaces 1.008 gram of hydrogen or 8.0 grams of oxygen or 35.5 grams of chlorine.",    
},
"theortical yeild":{
word:"theortical yeild",
lexicalCategory:"actual yeild/theortical yeild",
defination:" yield, also referred to as reaction yield, is the amount of product obtained in a chemical reaction. The absolute yield can be given as the weight in grams or in moles.",
